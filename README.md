# README

This repository aims to collect examples of EPICS Databases to help newcomers
(or not so new) get an idea on who to use different records.

The repository is organized on the follow way:
* Each folder has one example
* Each folder is named with the example number (0, 1, 2, ...), the numbering
has no relation with difficult level, only the order that the examples
were added
* Each example should have at least :
    * README.md
    * database file
* This README should work as a index, with the current list of all examples
